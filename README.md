# ChatGPT Playground

Welcome to ChatGPT Playground! This repository provides a platform for
experimenting with OpenAI's cutting-edge natural language processing API,
ChatGPT.

As a software engineer, you know that trial and error is the best way to learn a
new tool. That's why I've created this playground, where you can test and tweak
your code to see what works best. With ChatGPT, you can generate human-like
text, answer questions, complete sentences and carry out many other tasks that
would previously require extensive human effort.

I encourage you to join the growing community of developers using OpenAI's
language models to build cutting-edge chatbots, human-like assistants, and much
more. With this playground, you can quickly and easily familiarize yourself with
the possibilities available to you with ChatGPT.

## Getting Started

1.  Install prerequisites:
    1.  `sudo apt get python3.10`
    1.  `python3.10 -m pip install openai`
1.  Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
1.  Generate an OpenAI API key by following the instructions on the [OpenAI
    website](https://openai.com/platform/). This will require you to create an
    OpenAI account and to set up billing.
1.  Create a file in the root of this repository called `secret.txt`. In that
    file, paste your OpenAI API key, and nothing else.
1.  Try running `main.py` to open an interactive ChatGPT chat session!

## Usage

The `chatgpt-playground` repository contains a number of code examples that
demonstrate different use cases of the ChatGPT API. You can modify the examples
to see how the API responds to different input, or develop your own code to test
different concepts.

## Contributions

I welcome contributions from all developers, whether you're an experienced
software engineer or just getting started. If you have ideas for new example
code, or have found a bug that needs fixing, please don't hesitate to submit a
pull request.

Happy coding!
